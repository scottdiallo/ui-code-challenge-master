# UI Code Challenge

Task: Develop an HTML page based off the design shown in `CodeChallenge.jpg`. Make sure it is responsive from mobile to larger screens, and pixel perfect to the design.

Fonts: Karla Regular, Karla Bold, [available for free via Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

Requirements:
- Menu bar fixed to bottom of the page upon arrival, should move up to top of page upon scroll, and once it hits the top of the page, should remain fixed at top of page
- On page load, header section should fill the height of the browser window
- Main image with CSS gradient overlay, full screen stretch
- Do not use Bootstrap or other frameworks, roll your own CSS grids
- Clicking the arrow scrolls you down the page so that the white nav bar is at top of the screen
- Commit to GitHub as you go

Stretch Goals:
- Mobile and tablet styling
- Loader for main image
- Button and link hover effects
- Header area background image moves slightly as you scroll down the page (parallax)
- Second image fades in from white as you scroll down the page
- Optimize the page load speed by compressing the images for load time without losing picture quality, and refactoring your code
- Animate the arrow on hover
- Design of the footer
- Anything else you can come up with that will make the page better

Deliverables:
- HTML, CSS, JS.
